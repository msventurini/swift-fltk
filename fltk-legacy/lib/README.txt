lib/README.txt
--------------

This README file is a placeholder for FLTK library files on your system
if FLTK is built "in-tree", i.e. if the build folder is the same as the
source folder.

  *** This is strongly discouraged! ***

Building FLTK "out-of tree"

If FLTK is built using CMake all static and shared libraries are created
in the 'lib' subdirectory of the build tree. We strongly recommend to
build with CMake outside the source tree ("out-of-tree") as described
in README.CMake.txt in the root folder of the FLTK distribution.
